            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degreed C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and bell pepper; cook and stir until onion turns translucent and pepper begins to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms soften, about 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, tofu, chopped spinach, garlic, parsley, basil, oregano, salt, pepper and crushed pepper flakes into mushroom mixture. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer sauce for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour a layer of the sauce into the prepared baking dish. Cover with a layer of lasagna noodles. Add another layer of sauce and continue alternating layers of sauce and pasta, ending with sauce. Top with shredded cheese. Carefully add water. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven until pasta is fully cooked, about 40 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
            Check the lasagna after about 20 minutes in the oven. If lasagna is too dry and the pasta is still uncooked, add more water. If the pasta is cooked but the lasagna is too watery, cook uncovered for a few minutes.
