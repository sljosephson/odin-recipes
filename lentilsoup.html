    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <uo>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>2 celery ribs, chopped</li>
        <li>14 ounce can crushed or diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups dry green or brown lentils</li>
        <li>7 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups baby spinach, sliced into ribbons</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
    </uo>
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring frequently for about 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now add the can of tomatoes (with juices), lentils, vegetable broth, cumin, coriander and smoked paprika. Stir to incorporate everything.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes, until the lentils are tender and the soup has thickened. For a creamier texture, use an immersion blender to blend a few times in the pot. Alternatively, add 1-2 cups of the soup to a regular blender, blend until smooth and then return to the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir in the spinach and lemon juice. It will only take a minute for the spinach to wilt. Season with salt to taste.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
For a thinner soup, simply add more water or vegetable broth until the desired consistency is reached.
